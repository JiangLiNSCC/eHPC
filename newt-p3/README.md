NEWT 2.0
========

NEWT - Nice and Easy Web Toolkit, a ReSTFul API for High Performance Computing.

#Modules
The NEWT 2.0 is organized into 7 different, individually configurable modules. Each module is individually customizable by linking in a new adapter that conforms to the specification.
- **Account**: Gets information about users and groups on the system.
- **Authentication**: Deals with authentication of users.
- **Command**: Runs commands on the system.
- **File**: Create, remove, update, and delete objects in the file system.
- **Job**: Queues, monitors, and modifies jobs on the system.
- **Status**: Checks the status of each system.
- **Stores**: Provides a key-value storage system for applications using NEWT 2.0.

#Initial Setup
NEWT 2.0 is shipped with a local implementation of each of its different modules so it will function out of the box

##Runtime Requirements
- python 2.7.* (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip)

#Getting Started

##Understanding settings.py/local_settings.py
The `settings.py` file (soon to be easier to configure) contains global variables used to edit the functionality of NEWT 2.0. `settings.py` can be edited, but it is recommended to create a `local_settings.py` to overwrite the global variables to preserve the default settings. (See `newt/sample_local_settings.py`)

##Running the server
After changing any settings `./manage.py syncdb`, then run `./manage runserver` to start the server.

#Adapting NEWT
Adapting any module of NEWT to your system is a relatively simple task given experience in Python and Django. In each module, there is an `adapters` folder where new adapters should be placed. The specification for each adapter is given in `<adapter_name>/adapters/template_adapter.py`. 

##Abridged Example (django_adapter for Account)
Say we want to create a new adapter for Account that uses the Django user model to obtain user information. We would first make a copy of `template_adapter.py` into `django_adapter.py`. To add functionality, we see that in the `template_adapter.py` of the Account module, there is a definition for `get_user_info`
```Python
def get_user_info(user_name=None, uid=None):
    """Returns information about the user

    Keyword arguments:
    user_name -- username
    uid -- user id
    """
    pass

```
We would edit the body of the function to make make calls to the Django user model to obtain the information we want:

```Python
def get_user_info(user_name, uid):
    try:
        if uid:
            user = User.objects.get(pk=uid)
        elif user_name:
            user = User.objects.get(username=user_name)
        else:
            raise Exception() # Invalid arguments were given
        user_dict = model_to_dict(user)
        del user_dict["password"]
        return user_dict
    except Exception:
        if user_name:
            return json_response(
                status="ERROR", 
                status_code=404, 
                error="User not found: %s" % user_name
            )
        else:
            return json_response(
                status="ERROR", 
                status_code=404, 
                error="User ID not found: %s" % uid
            )
```
**Note**: This is only one of the two required functions in the adapter; a full example can be seen in `account/adapters/django_adapter.py`.

A couple things to note:

- The function takes in arguments specified by the API url
- The function is allowed to return any Python object, not necessarily a Django response. NEWT automatically wraps the returned values in a Django response.
- To explicitly return a valid API response, use `json_response(status="status", status_code=http_status_code, error="optional_error_message")`.

##Adapter Extras
Adapters also support API calls that are not in the default API endpoints. By adding to `patterns` (near the end of the sample adapter), the `extras_router` (required in every adapter for now) will add them to NEWT.

`patterns` is a tuple list in the form of:
```python
(
    (compiled_regex_exp, associated_function, request_required),
    ...
)
```

**Note**: The compiled_regex_exp must have [named groups](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html#non-capturing-and-named-groups) corresponding to the arguments of associated_function
**Note**: request_required tells NEWT to pass the request object to your function. If request_required is `True`, the associated_function must have request as the first argument

Example:
```python
patterns = (
    (re.compile(r'/usage/(?P<path>.+)$'), get_usage, False),
    (re.compile(r'/image/(?P<query>.+)$'), get_image, False),
    (re.compile(r'/(?P<path>.+)$'), get_resource, False),
)
```

##Models
Some adapters may need to store application specific state in the Django database.
In this case you can define a Django model (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/models/). You should use place your models file in the adapters/ directory 
and set the `NEWT_CONFIG['ADAPTERS'][application]['models']` to point to this in settings.py 


For example this is how you would get Django to store a credential object in the authnz adapter. Note that you need to specify the app_label in the `Meta` section of your model to point to the parent application

authnz/adapters/my_models.py:
```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Cred(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'authnz'
    cred = models.TextField()
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)

```

settings.py:
```python
NEWT_CONFIG = {
    
    'ADAPTERS': {

        'AUTH': {
            'adapter': 'authnz.adapters.my_adapter',
            'models': 'authnz.adapters.my_models',
        },
```

##Authenticated functions and adapters

You can enable authenticated access to the API at two levels:

#### 1. Authenticate an entire view
In the views.py function for a given API resource, you can change the implementing view to inherit from AuthJSONRestView instead of JSONRestView.

eg. In the store adapter views.py file, you will need to change
```python
from newt.views import JSONRestView

class StoreView(JSONRestView):
    def get(self, request, store_name):

```    
to
```python
from newt.views import AuthJSONRestView

class StoreView(AuthJSONRestView):
    def get(self, request, store_name):

```

#### 2. Authenticate a specific adapter function
Inside your adapter you can use the login_required decorator to force authentication on a specific function
eg. in file/adapters/globus_file_adapter.py
```python
from common.decorators import login_required

# Add the login_required decorator to force authentication on get_machines()
@login_required
def get_machines(request):

```
